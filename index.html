<h1> Development Placement </h1>
<p> This is the first, initial HelloWorld I have created. It will be added to throughout the course of my development placement. </p>
<h2> Initial Research </h2>
<p2> Throughout the first segment of my placement within development, I undertook a large amount of research in order to succinctly familiarise myself with the operation of development as a whole. </p2>
<p3> This notion was manifested as a result of a one-to-one meeting with my manager, Steven Beech, who outlined the basic structure of devops and key elements he felt were worthy of particular focus. Since then I looked into said specified areas and aspects of the role, in addition to the overarching methodologies and philosophies outlined to me in that first meeting. </p3>
