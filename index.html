<h1 style="color:DodgerBlue;">Development Placement</h1>
<p> This is the first, initial HelloWorld I have created. It will be added to throughout the course of my development placement. </p>
<h2> style="color:DodgerBlue;">Initial Research</h2>
<p2> Throughout the first segment of my placement within development, I undertook a large amount of research in order to succinctly familiarise myself with the operation of development as a whole. </p2>
<p3> This notion was manifested as a result of a one-to-one meeting with my manager, Steven Beech, who outlined the basic structure of devops and key elements he felt were worthy of particular focus. Since then I looked into said specified areas and aspects of the role, in addition to the overarching methodologies and philosophies outlined to me in that first meeting. </p3>
<h3> Methodologies and Approaches to Development </h3>
<p4> One aspect of software development I initially looked into was the differences in the separate approaches to development - namely Waterfall and Agile - and their respective strengths and weaknesses.The notion of agile vs waterfall is ubiquitous within development, and was therefore the first thing I researched to any extent. I primarily established the general structure and behaviours of both, and proceeded to look into their uses, functions and benefits/drawbacks. Furthermore, I subsequently proceeded to look into the Shift Left approach to working and its impact on devops since its incorporation. </p4> 
<h3> Quality in Software Development </h3>
<p5> Additionally I looked into the notion of quality within development and its impact on tech projects throughout their lifecycle. I attempted to define the term as a whole and ascertained the various aspects and attributes that contribute towards it (Reusability, Reliability, Maintainability etc.) </p5>
<h3> Different Roles Within Development </h3>
<p5> I established a variety of roles that make up both the development team and the client's team and outlined their various roles within the SDLC. I acknowledged the separate roles and how they work within one another and the responsibilities they each undertake. </p5>
