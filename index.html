<h1 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Development Placement</h1>

<p1>I have created this HelloWorld page in order to develop a portfolio describing and documenting my achievements within the placement so far in addition to functioninig as a visible indicator of the incremental development of my coding skills.</p1>

<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Development Research</h2>

<p2> I initially partook in a one-on-one meeting with my manager, Steven Beech, who spent some time outlining the basic principles, functions and structure on software development and this framework formed the basis of my research from thereonin. I looked into a variety of areas within the industry and subsequently presented my findings back to him. The substance of my research was then formulated into a presentation to be used as a reference point for my placement going forward and as an introduction to the department for futurethe d graduates. My areas of focus are outlined below. </p2>

<h3 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Methodologies and Approaches to Software Development</h3>

<p3> Primarily I focussed on the overarching methodologies and approached to working within development, their differences, benefits, drawbacks, function and impact on development as a whole. This mainly consisted of differences between the rigidity of waterfall and the fluidity and adaptability of agile and how each of them are utilised within the industry. Furthermore, I looked into the emergence of the Shift Left culture and its uses, in addition to querying what aspects of each approach could be incorporated to achieve the ideal way of working for a particular project </p3>
