<h1 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Development Placement</h1>

<p1>I have created this HelloWorld page in order to develop a portfolio describing and documenting my achievements within the placement so far in addition to the incremental development of my coding skills.</p1>

<h2 style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Development Research</h2>

<p2> I initially partook in a one-on-one meeting with my manager, Steven Beech, who spent some time outlining the basic principles, functions and structure on software development and this framework formed the basis of my research from thereonin. I looked into a variety of areas within the industry and subsequently presented my findings back to him. The substance of my research was then formulated into a presentation to be used as a reference point for my placement going forward and as an introduction to the department for future graduates. My areas of focus are outlined below. </p2>
