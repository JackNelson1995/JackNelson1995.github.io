<h1 style="color:Indigo; border:2px solid MediumSpringGreen;">Development Placement</h1>

<p1 style="color: Indigo;">I have created this HelloWorld page in order to develop a portfolio describing and documenting my achievements within the placement so far in addition to functioninig as a visible indicator of the incremental development of my coding skills.</p1>

<h2 style="color:Indigo; border:2px solid MediumSpringGreen;">Development Research</h2>

<p2 style="color:Indigo;"> I initially partook in a one-on-one meeting with my manager, Steven Beech, who spent some time outlining the basic principles, functions and structure on software development and this framework formed the basis of my research from thereonin. I looked into a variety of areas within the industry and subsequently presented my findings back to him. The substance of my research was then formulated into a presentation to be used as a reference point for my placement going forward and as an introduction to the department for future graduates. My areas of focus are outlined below. </p2>

<h3 style="color:Indigo; border:2px solid MediumSpringGreen;">Methodologies and Approaches to Software Development</h3>

<p3 style="color:Indigo;"> Primarily I focussed on the overarching methodologies and approached to working within development, their differences, benefits, drawbacks, function and impact on development as a whole. This mainly consisted of differences between the rigidity of waterfall and the fluidity and adaptability of agile and how each of them are utilised within the industry. Furthermore, I looked into the emergence of the Shift Left culture and its uses, in addition to querying what aspects of each approach could be incorporated to achieve the ideal way of working for a particular project </p3>

<h3 style="color:Indigo; border:2px solid MediumSpringGreen;">Quality in Software Development</h3>

<p4 style="color:Indigo;"> I proceeded to look into what attributes and functions and contributors towards quality within a development project and how to define the term holistically. I looked into the subsections within the term which can be used as quality measurements (reliabiltiy, adequacy, maintainability etc.) and how they can be defined. </p4>

<h3 style="color:Indigo; border:2px solid MediumSpringGreen;">Different Roles Within Development</h3>

<p5 style="color:Indigo;"> I also looked into the different roles available within the industry, the purpose of their role, and how they all work together to create an efficent, successful and thoroughly agile workforce. I now have developed a clear and precise notion of each role and their duties, responsibilities and what they bring to DevOps as a whole.<p5>

<h3 style="color:Indigo; border:2px solid MediumSpringGreen;">Software Distribution Models & Functions</h3>

<p6 style="color:Indigo;"> I subsequently researched the various forms of software distribution models and functions, and the variety of purposes and requirements they are each capable of fulfilling. These included SaaS, COTS and Bespoke applications. I looked into the pros and cons of each, in addition to which type of projects suit each distribution model.</p6>
